#JavaScript: Chaining Array Methods

## Discription


Using one single line of JavaScript code, the following tasks were executed: 

Sorting the array of numbers in descending order;  
Remove any integers greater than 19;
Multiply each remaining number by 1.5 and then subtract 1;
Then output (either in the DOM or the console) the sum of all the resulting numbers.


## How to run in your terminal
```
http-server -p 9999

```
then navigate to [http://localhost:9999](http://localhost:9999) in your browser.
